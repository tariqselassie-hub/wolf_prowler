# Wolf Prowler Theme Implementation Plan

## High Priority Items
- [x] Add wolf-themed visual elements - paw print icons, wolf silhouettes, moon phases
- [x] Implement wolf pack terminology - replace 'peers' with 'pack members', 'network' with 'territory'
- [x] Add wolf den hideout feature - encrypted vault for sensitive data
- [x] Implement wolf communication system - encrypted howl messages between pack members

## Medium Priority Items
- [x] Add wolf sound effects - howl animations, growl alerts for security threats
- [x] Create alpha/beta/omega hierarchy system for user roles and permissions
- [x] Implement scent trail visualization for network data flow
- [x] Create hunting pack mode - coordinated network scanning feature

## Low Priority Items
- [x] Add lunar cycle calendar for scheduling security sweeps and pack meetings
- [x] Add territory marking system - visual network boundary indicators

## Implementation Notes
- Start with terminology changes (easiest, high impact)
- Add visual elements next (CSS/icons)
- Implement advanced features last (requires backend changes)
- Test each change to ensure system stability
