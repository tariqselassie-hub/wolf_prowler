# Wolf Prowler Feature Flags
#
# This file allows you to enable or disable specific features of the Wolf Prowler platform.
# This is useful for development and for progressively enabling functionality as it becomes stable.
#
# Set a feature to `true` to enable it, or `false` to disable it.
# The application code should read this configuration to conditionally compile or execute feature-specific code.
